# Data preprocessing

The preprocessed CGED dataset is sourced from the writing section of the HSK (Pinyin of *Hanyu Shuiping Kaoshi*, Test of Chinese Level) (Cui et al, 2011; Zhang et al, 2013). Native Chinese speakers were trained to manually annotate grammatical errors and provide corrections corresponding to each error.

The data has already been uniformly converted to simplified Chinese characters. Some samples that were removed from the original datasets contain the following problems: (1) too short (<5/<7); (2) have significant annotation issues; (3)  only have errors limited to punctuation, which barely contributes to the grammaticality judgement.
